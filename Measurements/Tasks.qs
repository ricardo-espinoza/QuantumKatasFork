    // Welcome!

    // "Measurements" quantum kata is a series of exercises designed 
    // to get you familiar with programming in Q#.
    // It covers the following topics:
    //  - single-qubit measurements,
    //  - discriminating orthogonal and nonorthogonal states.
    //
    // Each task is wrapped in one operation preceded by the description of the task.
    // Each task (except tasks in which you have to write a test) has a unit test associated with it,
    // which initially fails. Your goal is to fill in the blank (marked with // ... comment)
    // with some Q# code to make the failing test pass.
    //
    // The tasks are given in approximate order of increasing difficulty; harder ones are marked with asterisks.
