# Welcome!

The superposition kata covers the following topics:
 - basic single-qubit and multi-qubit gates
 - superposition
 - flow control and recursion in Q#

It is recommended to complete the basic gates kata before this one to get familiar with the basic gates used in quantum computing. The list of basic gates available in Q# can be found at [Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/qsharp/api/prelude/microsoft.quantum.primitive).

You can find detailed coverage of Bell states and their creation [here](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/uk_faculty_connection/2018/02/06/a-beginners-guide-to-quantum-computing-and-q/).

For the syntax of flow control statements in Q#, see [the Q# documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/quantum-qr-statements#control-flow).
