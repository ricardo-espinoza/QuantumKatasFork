# Welcome!

The teleportation kata covers quantum teleportation - a protocol which allows to communicate a quantum state
using only classical communication and previously shared quantum entanglement.

 - Teleportation is described as an example in [the Q# documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/quantum-techniques-6-puttingitalltogether).
 - Another description can be found in [the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_teleportation).

The principle of deferred measurement, applied to teleportation protocol, is described in Nielsen & Chuang, section 4.4 (pp. 185-187).
